# Memory Game
A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. 

## Rules of Memory Game
- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches:
    - A message below the grid notifies you;
    - You get +1 to your score;
    - These cards then stay "flipped"
- If the next card you flip does not match, or is at the same position of your previous flip:
    - A message below the grid notifies you
    - The cards flip back
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.

## Your Tasks
Before working on the Memory Game, you will first learn how to use the interface in `tutorial.js` from the side bar of the editor.
After that, there are some bugs in `app.js` that you will need to fix.
You will then go to `app.js` for the instructions.

# Calculator
A calculator in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

## Rules of Calculator
- You will start by pressing some numeric keys to enter a value, which can be with or without a decimal point.
- When you use the operand for an operation, the operand as well as the operation symboll will appear at the top of the calculator,
  while new values will still be displayed in the usual area.
- If you press the "equal" key, the value will be updated with the result of your operation.
- If you press the "del" key, the last digit of your value will be removed.
- If you press the "AC" key, the value will be reset.

## Your Tasks
Before working on the Calculator, you will first learn how to use the interface in `tutorial.js` from the side bar of the editor.
After that, there are some bugs in `app.js` that you will need to fix.
You will then go to `app.js` for the instructions.
